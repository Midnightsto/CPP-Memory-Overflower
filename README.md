# CPP-Memory-Overflower
Some little functions for C++ that are made to use all the computer's resources. Just made this because I'm bored.

Use this at your own risk, I'm not responsible for any damage you do.

You would normally use the HardDriveDestroyer function because it does it's purpose very well :D
